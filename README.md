🚀 Built a Minimalist Developer Portfolio (HTML • CSS • JavaScript)

I recently designed and developed a black & white themed personal portfolio from scratch using only core web technologies.
The focus was on clarity, structure, and user experience rather than heavy animations or frameworks.

Key highlights:

Clean, responsive layout

Dark / light mode toggle

Scroll-based reveal interactions

Well-structured sections for skills, experience, projects & certifications

Fully handcrafted with HTML, CSS & JavaScript

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of layout systems, spacing, typography, and UI consistency, while keeping the design simple and professional.

Always learning, always building. ✨
Feedback and suggestions are welcome!
